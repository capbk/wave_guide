i'm becoming annoyed by the large numbe of playlists clogging my library
    X does the API now support creating folders -- NO as of 2024-11-10
    ? give some fun names to the playlists
        create fun playlist titles with small language model
    ? play in app and then add a second step to create playlist?
        in app listening would also make it easier to build user feedback into UX
    X add to queue instead of creating playlist
        don't love this because then Spotify doesn't automatically keep the vibe going
    X can there be a TTl on a playlist
        could be very frustrating for playlists to disappear if you like them
